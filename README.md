# ðŸ§  Linux Virtual Machine & Bash Scripting

**Summary:**  
Hands-on Linux project demonstrating system setup, automation, and Bash scripting in a virtualized Ubuntu environment. Showcases real-world skills in command-line operations, user administration, and custom automationâ€”core competencies for cloud and DevOps roles.

---

### **What**
- Configured an **Ubuntu VM** and verified full system setup.  
- Demonstrated advanced **Bash command-line** and scripting techniques.  
- Applied **internal/external commands**, quoting, and **control statements** (`;`, `&&`, `||`, `if`, `for`, `while`).  
- Managed **user/system accounts**, privileges, and session tracking (`sudo`, `who`, `w`, `last`).  
- Automated **terminal customization** and **disk-space alerts** via `.bashrc` scripting.

- Built and configured the VM entirely through the command line.  
- Created **Bash scripts** for:  
  - **Dynamic welcome banners** using `figlet`, `toilet`, and `lolcat`.  
  - **Automated disk-usage monitoring** with >80% alert thresholds.  
- Embedded automation in `.bashrc` for persistent runtime execution.  

---

### **Why**
- To **demonstrate proficiency** in Linux administration and shell scripting.  
- To **apply automation** for real system operations and monitoring.  
- To **strengthen core skills** essential for cloud engineering and DevOps environments.
